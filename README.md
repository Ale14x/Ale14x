### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! I introduce my self. I'm Alessandro Luca Cremasco, I'm 20 y/o, I live in Italy and currently I'm studying Informatics at the University of Verona.

**My dream?** Develope my first app and become a developer. That's it, for now...  

Currently I'm having fun writing scripts in Javascript, a language for which I always had an interest. While at the first year of University I learned to resolve problems in C and now at the second one I have just began to write code in Java.

I hope to extend my knowledge in coding here on **GitHub** and knowing other developers that share my passion!

See you on *GitHub*!
